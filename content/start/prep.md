You can download Twine as a desktop software or use it in your web browser. Both versions are fully functional and use the same interface.  But, if you are using an Android or iOS device, web browser is your only option to use Twine. 

You can install Twine on Windows, macOS, or Linux. Its latest releases are accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/releases).
