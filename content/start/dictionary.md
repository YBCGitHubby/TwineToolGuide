#### Story
In Twine, a story refers to a narrative or interactive experience created using the Twine software consisting of passages linked together to form a branching and dynamic narrative structure.

#### Passage

A Twine story is often made up of passages, which are individual units of text or content. Each passage can contain text, links to other passages, and sometimes even multimedia elements. The links between passages create the branching structure of the story, allowing for multiple paths and outcomes based on the choices made by the reader.

#### Links

A link refers to a connection between different passages in your interactive story. Links are used to create the branching structure of the narrative, allowing the reader/player to make choices that determine the direction of the story. In a Twine story, passages are connected through these links, and each link typically represents a decision point or a transition to another part of the story.

#### Library 

Library is the collection of stories stored in Twine. Your library is private and not directly shareable, but you have options to import, export, and archive individual stories. There's no set limit on the number of stories you can have in your library; the only constraint is the storage capacity of the location where your stories are saved. 

#### Story Map (Passages View)

Story Map is the visual representation of the structure and flow of a story in Twine. It is a checkered canvas where each passage in it is represented by a card, and links between them are shown as lines with arrows. You can zoom in and out of the map using the three buttons on the corner of the Story Map screen.

#### Story Format 

Story format refers to a specific set of rules and conventions that define how the interactive story is structured, how passages are written, and how the overall experience is presented. Twine supports multiple story formats, and each format comes with its own features and capabilities. The choice of format affects the tools and capabilities available to you during the creation of your interactive story.

Within the Twine platform, three distinct story formats exist: [Harlowe](https://twine2.neocities.org/), [SugarCube](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/), and [Snowman](https://videlais.github.io/snowman/#/). By default, Twine 2 utilizes the Harlowe format. For users with limited or no programming experience, Harlowe is recommended as the most suitable option. Alternatively, for those proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, SugarCube presents itself as a more adept choice. Furthermore, SugarCube benefits from a greater abundance of tutorials compared to Harlowe. Finally, individuals well-versed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are encouraged to opt for the Snowman.
