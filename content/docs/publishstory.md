## PLAY 

You can preview your story at any stage to test it by using `Test From Here` button from the `Passage` view tab or `Test` button from the `Build` tab. You can also initiate the playback of a story from both the `Story Library` and `Story Map` screens in Twine choosing `Play` from the Build tab. 

It's important to note that the web browser address displayed while playing a game launched from Twine is specific to your computer and will not work for others. If you intend to share your story with other people, you'll need to publish it.

## PUBLISH

When you publish your story in Twine, it creates an HTML file that can be opened in a web browser. Use `Publish to File` from the `Build` tab. Twine will then ask you to choose a file name and location to save your published file.

You can upload your story file to a web server, file hosting service, or a platform that allows you to share web content. This could be a personal website, GitHub Pages, [itch.io](https://itch.io/), [Borogove](https://borogove.app/) or any other hosting service.
