Twine is a free and open-source digital tool for creating interactive, nonlinear stories or choose-your-own adventure games using hypertext. Enabling the creation of narratives through intuitive hyperlinks, Twine allows readers to navigate decision points, clicking through diverse scenarios that shape distinct outcomes. 

Knowledge of coding is not necessary to create stories with Twine. However, knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can help create more complicated ones. 

Whether you're a storyteller, educator, or game enthusiast, Twine provides an intuitive space for unleashing your creative potential.
